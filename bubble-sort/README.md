# Bubble Sort Notes
    Bubble sort is Brute Force Sorting. 
    This is efficient than a selection sort in best case because no need to pass through the array more than once 
    if it is alreaddy in order.
  # Time Complexity
      Best Case : O(n)  
      Avg. Case:  O(n^2)
      Worst Case: O(n^2)
      
  # Stability
      Yes
  # Approach
      1. Compare adjacent elements to determine if they are in order with respect to each other.  
      2. If they aren't, swap them.
      3. Repeat until pass through the entire array without needing to swap any elements
